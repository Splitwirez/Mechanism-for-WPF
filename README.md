# Mechanism-for-WPF
Mechanism for WPF is a largely-legacy control library I created a while back, and is only maintained for a few specific apps. I've largely moved to Avalonia in pursuit of cross-platform app development, and have brought Mechanism with me. The Avalonia version of Mechanism can be found here: https://github.com/Splitwirez/Mechanism-for-Avalonia

If you're interested, I'd encourage you to consider moving your app to Avalonia - locking people into Windows isn't all it's cracked up to be anymore, after all. However, if your app is truly chained to Windows and can't be decoupled from it, then do feel free to use this library as you see fit, fork off and improve upon it, or whatever else you see fit, as long as it's nothing outright malicious. Just do everyone a favour and see if you can get your app to at least run under WINE, okay? Or failing that, leave the door open for someone else to do so.
